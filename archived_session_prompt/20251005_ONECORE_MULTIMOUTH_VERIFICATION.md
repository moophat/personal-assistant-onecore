VERIFY ONLY (no edits): Can current PoC grow into "One Core, Many Mouths" without structural rewrites?

CORE EXTRACTION READINESS: A) LLM interaction logic (OpenRouter call + memory management) is isolated in reusable modules (not embedded in CLI REPL loop). B) REPL logic (prompt_toolkit, slash commands, display) is separated from conversation logic. C) Config/template loading is callable from any context (not CLI-specific).

MEMORY PORTABILITY: D) SessionMemory class supports multiple session_id (not hardcoded to "default"). E) Memory operations (add message, get history) are synchronous or can be made async without breaking interface. F) No hidden global state - memory instance can be passed/injected.

MULTI-SURFACE READY: G) Core modules return plain data (dicts/objects), not formatted strings or CLI output. H) No direct calls to print() or logging in business logic (only in CLI adapter). I) No CLI-only imports (prompt_toolkit/sys.stdin) in memory/config/llm modules.

EVENT STREAM READY: J) LLM response handling can support streaming (even if not implemented - check if ChatOpenAI stream=True would work). K) Response processing doesn't assume single blocking call (compatible with event-driven pattern).

ADAPTER PATTERN READY: L) Current REPL loop can be refactored into an adapter that calls a ChatService without rewriting memory/config/llm logic. M) Slash commands are CLI-specific and won't leak into shared core.

Report findings only. Flag any patterns that would force rewrites when adding Chainlit/HTTP adapters.
